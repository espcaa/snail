# snail

mod loader for slack desktop app, inspired from my last attempt, [slack-plugin-thingy](https://github/espcaa/slack-plugin-thingy)

## setup

- install [go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- clone this repo 
- run `go install` to install dependencies
- run `cd /src && go run .` to patch your slack client

you can also download prebuilt binaries from the [releases tab](https://github.com/espcaa/snail/releases) for macos and linux

## usage

- run your slack client :D
- you should see a plugin icon near your user info
- click it to open the plugin manager!
